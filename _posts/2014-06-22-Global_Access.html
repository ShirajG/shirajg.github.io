        <h4><span>The Tech World is not Enough</span></h4>
        <p>
          For this weeks cultural blog, I have chosen to write about a problem facing the 
          tech world. In my opinion, one of the major problems in the tech world, is the 
          fact that the "tech world" is nowhere near encompassing the whole world. I think 
          solving this problem will lead to an improvement in the lives of billions of
          people, and truly change the world.

          There is no doubt that as the world becomes more interconnected by technology, life is getting better. Everything from trivial concerns like food delivery 
          and picture sharing all the way up to education and political activism have benefited from the innovations made by the tech world. Everyone that is hooked 
          into the new information sharing age has reaped the benefits of it. The huge problem, is that not everyone is a part of this new world.

          Check out the following graph of the percentage of Internet users from Wikipedia:

          There is a huge discrepancy between the percentage of the developed world using the
          Internet, and developed countries. People in these developing areas face serious challenges, like access to food, water, education and infrastructure that we do not. I find this ironic, because the very problems that developing nations are trying to overcome, would be much easier to deal with if there was a more free exchange of information and ideas.

          Here in America, we can use an app like Uber to make our already comfortable lives just a bit cushier. In a struggling third world country an app like that could easily be re-purposed into a way to organize a collective transportation system to take kids to school in places where the government has no money to do so. A simple thing like that could have a huge impact on the educational outcomes of the next generation of kids in these areas.

          We take resources like Khan Academy, Coursera and Wikipedia for granted because our access to them is ubiquitous. We no longer appreciate how big of a difference ready access to information makes in our lives. We have access to learn about any topic right on our computers or phones. This is not the case in the developing world.
        </p>

          The difference in the quality of life that having access to to information makes
          for a person in the developing world is huge. It can allow for people to research
          solutions to problems that face them, and try to implement these solutions. This encourages people to be more self reliant, and to start believing that they can effect change in their world. This puts a lot of power in the hands of the populace, who no longer need to wait for some government bureaucrat to decide their fates.

          The sticking point of this problem is that it actually boils down to being an 
          infrastructure problem. Laying cable to connect villages to the Internet is 
          expensive, and having an educated and self reliant population seems to be low on the priority list of most governments. This is ultimately a problem that can't be solved by some "killer app" but needs a real effort by developed countries to figure out a way to make access to the Internet available to people where there is
          no infrastructure in place.
