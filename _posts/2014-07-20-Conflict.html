        <h4><span>Dealing with Conflict</span></h4>
        <p>
          This weeks topic is that of dealing with conflict. This is a very important topic when it comes
          to the workplace, as well as daily life. Sources of conflict are all around us, and how we deal with 
          these conflicts can determine how happy we are. In this post I will go into some of the common sources
          of conflict, some sub optimal coping techniques, and then some good ways to handle conflict. Hopefully this will 
          help you to better deal with conflicts in your future.

          There are many potential sources of conflict in our everyday life where we have to interact with a wide range of people and circumstances. Some of the most common conflicts you will face when working in a close knit group is that of conflicting working styles and personalities. One person may like to work in a very linear manner, and may dislike working out of order, meanwhile another team member may prefer a more abstract approach. When you are forced to have to work with someone who has a different working style, there is a lot of room for conflict. It can be tiring having to work through a task in a way that you do not understand or like. People can also value things differently. Something that you feel is extremely important on your list of priorities may not be so valued by someone else. Having to work with someone who does not value the things you do can also be a source of conflict. This can lead to pent up frustration and anxiety, which can eventually lead to poor performance at work and maybe even health problems.

          One example of a conflict in my life that I had to deal with, was when I was working in financial sales, and we had to generate lead lists. I ended up figuring out a good system for getting leads, that was potentially worth real money. I would actually generate more leads than I could handle myself, so I would let other people call some of the leads, provided I was cut in on any sales. As I should have seen coming, people eventually felt conflicted about giving me a percentage from what they saw as their own efforts. I am usually a pretty relaxed and calm guy, but this just did not sit well with me. As soon as I heard about it I became very angry and could feel my heart pounding with adrenaline. I felt like I had been taken advantage of and my good will had been returned with betrayal. I ended up having a pretty serious argument with a few of these co-workers, and came to no resolution other than that I stop working with and helping them.

          This was a tough experience for me, because I really had no one to blame but myself for being naive, and we were all pretty good friends otherwise. This definitely lead to a period of withdrawal for me, where I interacted much less with the people at work, and generally did my job and went home. This also created a lot of anxiety for me, knowing that I would have to go in to work and see the people who I was not getting along with. I definitely felt a mix of self hate for being too trusting, and a decent amount of dislike for the people who had broken our agreement. In hindsight this was probably more damaging to my work performance than losing out on a few small payouts would have been. I definitely should not have allowed my own wishes to be dismissed, but I also should not have demanded things go only how I wanted.

          I think my actions in this situation did not really resolve anything, because I was in too much of an emotionally worked up state. This leads to making rash decisions, and not fully thinking the situation through to try and come up with a better compromise. Interestingly enough, I am still pretty good friends with one of these co-workers involved in the dispute. I think this is because I was able to take a look at the situation again with a cooler head and could see the other sides points. Up to now I've heavily skewed the story I've told you about what happened, but another aspect of the conflict, as seen from their side, was that I was charging way too much for what amounted to a few very iffy phone numbers. There were also readily available sources for these kinds of leads available for cheaper than what I would have charged, the only downside being that you had to pay for them up front, regardless of whether they lead to any sales. We later ended up coming to a better compromise that would let me get paid a smaller but more fair amount, and workplace tension and conflict was successfully defused.

          The main lesson I took away from this, is that most conflicts have more than one side to them, and to make a really good decision you need to be in an emotionally stable place, and open to compromise. I think this mindset can go a long way, regardless of what the specifics of the conflict are. Finding a way to communicate in a non emotionally charged way is the key to handling disputes in a way that is beneficial to you and the people you work with.
