  For this weeks technical blog I will be diving into an analysis of the popularity and usefulness of JavaScript (henceforth JS). So what is JS? According to Wikipedia JS is a dynamic computer programming language. It is most commonly used as part of web browsers, whose implementations allow client-side scripts to interact with the user, control the browser, communicate asynchronously, and alter the document content that is displayed. This seems like a mouthful but as I break it down it will hopefully make more sense.
  </p>

  <p>
  JS is the language which is used to add interactivity to the web. Without JS the web is a pretty static place. Once a page is loaded, that's how it stays. If you want to change anything after that, like the color of a heading or the font of a paragraph, you are out of luck. JS is the magic which allows you to select and manipulate elements of a web page after it has loaded. This is done by selecting elements in the DOM(document object model) and then modifying the properties of that object. You can use JS to change the color of buttons, make drop down menus, or even create animations. A lot of the interactivity that you now take for granted on the web is due to JS.
  </p>
  <p>
   In the days before JS's widespread adoption, the web was a much more static place. Most interactivity was in the form of flash applets, which required you to install a bloated and buggy plug-in to work. As JS became more and more mature, it has enabled a wide range of interactivity in the browser without the need to install any plug-ins. If you've ever used a form which checks its input fields for valid entries, or used a web app that lets you receive real time updates without reloading the page, you've used JS.
  </p>

  <p>
  This brings us to the most obvious reason for JS's popularity, its ubiquity. If you have ever used Firefox, Chrome, or Internet Explorer you have used JS. It's built into all modern browsers! A corollary to this fact is that anyone can program in it, with no additional software. As long as you have access to a basic text editor (notepad on windows, textEdit on mac) you can start writing your JS program. </p>
  <p>
  JS is an interpreted language, which means that you don't have to compile it into machine language before you can run it. You only need to feed your code into a JavaScript interpreter and it will run your code right there. It happens to be the case that every browser is also a JS interpreter! You can load up your JS file and see the results right there in the browser. You can even debug it from the browser console. In effect, everyone that has a browser installed already has a full (albeit barebones) development environment for writing programs in JS installed already!
  </p>
  <p>
  Since JS is so widely used, it also benefits from having been used to solve a ton of everyday problems already. These solutions have been stored as libraries that anyone can access. jQuery is one of these libraries and it makes the task of selecting and manipulating the DOM a piece of cake. If it wasn't for JS's huge user base, it would have fallen to the individual developer to create these tools for him/herself. You no longer need to solve basic and tedious problems yourself since the odds are that someone out there has done it already and done it better as well.
  </p>
  <p>
   
  JS's wheelhouse seems to be in client-side interactions on the web, things like animating elements of the page, validating user input, and generally adding spice to the otherwise static world of HTML. However, this is not the only thing JS is capable of. JS is a fully fleshed out programming language, and can be used to create any kind of program that you want. JS is now even being used for server side work via many popular JS frameworks, such as node.js, angular and backbone. This lets developers who are already familiar with JS on the front-end side of things, transition seamlessly into using the same language for doing their back end work. This means that you don't need to spend time learning a new language for back end work.
  </p>

  <p>
  And last but not least is the employment potential for JS. You can work on front-end or back-end if you know JS well. There are many more jobs for JS than there are for even Ruby or C++. It is an essential tool in any developer's belt and will make you more flexible in the kind of jobs you can handle.
  </p>

  <p>
  I think JS on the whole has a bright future, and will continue to grow and become used even more widely than it is right now. It already enjoys a huge user base, is easy to work with, and can be used to create anything you may want. All without having to learn a new language.
