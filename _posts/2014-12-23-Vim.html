<h4><span>Setting up VIM</span></h4>

<p> 
This post is going to be all about how to set up Vim for working in Ruby and Javascript. I've been messing around a lot with my Vim workflow lately, and trying to get it to be as fast as possible. I'm going to try to document the really helpful plugins and settings that I'm using to help out anyone in the future who might be looking for this same info.
</p>
<p>
The first plugin that I've found really useful was <a class="inline-link" href="https://github.com/kien/ctrlp.vim">ctrlp</a>. This plugin adds Sublime like Ctrl+P functionality for quickly opening files within your project. I've found it to speed up navigation to the same level as Sublime.
</p>
<p>
The next plugin that I've found really helpful is the amazing <a class="inline-link" href="https://github.com/Valloric/YouCompleteMe">YouCompleteMe</a>. This plugin offers great realtime autocompletion in Ruby and Javascript. It can be compiled to have support for the C family of languages as well, but I haven't really bothered with that yet.
</p>
<p>
Another super handy plugin for Ruby is the <a class="inline-link" href="https://github.com/tpope/vim-endwise">endwise</a> plugin which automatically completes do/if/while blocks with and end. This is super quick, and promotes a really fluid workflow when working in Ruby.
</p>
In that same vein I have a few mappings in my .vimrc that speed up placing parentheses in Javascript. Here they are:</p>
<p>inoremap {&lt;CR&gt; {&lt;CR&gt;}&lt;Esc&gt;ko</p> 
<p>inoremap (&lt;CR&gt; (&lt;CR&gt;)&lt;Esc&gt;ko</p> 
<p>inoremap [&lt;CR&gt; [&lt;CR&gt;]&lt;Esc&gt;ko</p> 
<p> These mappings automate one of the most tedious tasks in coding, inserting matching parentheses.
