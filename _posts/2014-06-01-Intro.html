        <h4><span>Kitchen vs Restaurant</span></h4>
        <p>Watching the fireside chat video was a good intro to a lot of the thinking and culture behind DevBootcamp. It made it seem more like an actual place run by human beings, and not some kind of faceless entity. </p>
        <p>It was refreshing to see the founder talking about the real challenges facing the school as well as students. It was interesting to see that the school is still considered an ongoing experiment. I like the fact that there is still room for the program to grow and improve.</p>
        <p>I also thought it was a good point that even though some students may be ahead of others, we all still have a long journey ahead of us, and where we started will not matter much in the long run. I hope I will be able to work as hard as I can and grow.</p>
        <p>I'm already excited by all the challenges that we are going through in this prep phase, and am trying to learn as much as I can on my own in order to try to prepare for pahse 1. I really want to be prepared, but I have a feeling it's going to be overwhelming no matter what.</p>
        <p>I especially liked the point Shereef made about a kitchen mindset vs a restaurant mindset. With the restaurant mindset we would treat this experience as a paid for commodity, and expect things of it. With a restaurant mentality we realize that what we get out of this is in our hands, and we can get out exactly what we put into it. It's actually a very empowering mindset, and I am looking forward to seeing what I can do to maximize my experience here.</p>
