        <h4><span>My Values</span></h4>
        <p>
          For this weeks cultural post I was asked to write about the values that are important to me, and ways that I can use these values to help me in my life.
          When I think of the times in my life when I've been the happiest, and most satisfied in my life, I feel that a certain few values have been present in these situations.
          I'm going to go through these values, and why I feel they are  important to me.

        <p>
          I've always enjoyed times where there are challenges to be
          taken on. Challenges make me feel like I am doing something meaningful with my time, and my particular skills and abilities are making a difference. When a task is given to me
          that is not challenging, I feel like anyone could have done it, and there's really nothing gained by my having tackled it.

          I also like being autonomous and creative. I feel like these values go hand in hand. I like being given the opportunity to chose my own direction, and then figure out how to make things happen. This is a challenge, as well as a chance to be more creative and show people what I can accomplish on my own without having to be told what to do. Being creative is the best way to solve any kind of challenge. Without creativity you will always have to rely on others to solve problems for you, and you will never be more than just an order taker/instruction follower. I would imagine that this is not most peoples goal in life, yet it does happen. I think I actively try to avoid situations where there is little room for independent thinking and creativity because I find these kinds of environments boring and stifling.

          I also find enthusiasm for what I am doing to be a key value for me. If I am involved in any kind of challenge that I'm enthusiastic about, it becomes almost like an obsession of trying to make it work. I love the thrill of tackling problems when I know the end goal is going to be something really cool. Working long hours on a problem that I want to solve just for my own curiosity is almost like a hobby for me. It gives me new avenues to explore, and lets me keep learning new things about all aspects of the world.

          One other key value in my life is order. I like things in my life to have some kind of order to them, and I really dislike when that order gets messed up. I like order because it lets me free my mind of worrying about things because I know everything is ordered in a logical way, and I just have to deal with one thing at a time. I think this also leads me to place a lot of value on peacefulness, because that's really what I want. I want an environment that has as few stressors as possible, and lets me do the things I like without worrying about a ton of other things. I also bring this focus on order and peace with me into my everyday relationships. I am very good at trying to solve disagreements/conflicts in a fair way and am willing to listen to others suggestions and opinions in order to reach a state where everyone can feel valued and heard. When I do feel the beginnings of a conflict, I like to disarm it as soon as possible, before it grows into a larger issue, and looms over my head and makes me worry.

          I think I do a good job at living my life according to the values that I find important. I actually don't know what I would do with my time if I wasn't trying to challenge myself and create things. I always try to challenge myself, no matter what I'm doing. I try to find new things to cook on a regular basis, just to see if I can. I also look for new skills to learn and ways to improve my existing skills. This gives a lot of structure and meaning to my life.
        </p>

          I definitely live up to being an ordered person. I try to separate all the different responsibilities I have in my life into neatly manageable chunks. I know that once I go through my work in any one area, I can stop worrying about that chunk of tasks. I hate leaving things unfinished and out of order, because that means I have to mentally carry around an incomplete to-do list, and always have the worry in the back of my mind "am I forgetting something?". Keeping things neatly organized lets me feel more confident about myself, and it also allows me to relax more fully, because I am sure I have everything running smoothly.

          I was also asked to write about the last time someone asked me for advice about something, and the best examples that I can think of all involve computer stuff. One friend recently asked me about what kind of computer he could afford, and I helped him price it together, see if that was in his range, and then I helped him build it. I liked doing these kinds of projects because they are somewhat challenging, and I feel really enthusiastic about the end product. I also like being able to create an ordered process out of something that can be chaotic. It's not the easiest thing to be able to look through a large list of components and figure out what you need, and what will be compatible with the other parts you've picked, but by working in an ordered way I was able to break down the process for my friend, and get him to understand it.

          When I think about my values, I feel that they are a good representation of who I am as a person. Most of my decisions in life are based on these values, and I like being able to have a clear picture about what kind of things are going to lead me to enjoyable and satisfying activities. I think this will help me to get through challenging times at DBC because I will know that I have chosen to be here because the experience is well aligned with my values. I won't have to second guess myself and will know that I picked the experience based on what I already know about myself.
