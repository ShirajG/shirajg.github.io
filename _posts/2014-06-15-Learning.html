        <h4><span>Learning</span></h4>
        <p>  
        This weeks cultural blog deals with our personal learning styles. I think it is important to understand how we most efficiently process information in order to maximize our experience at DevBootcamp. It is going to be a very intense and fast paced program, so we will need every advantage. One of the ways to do this is to tailor our experience to take advantage of our natural styles of thinking. </p><p>

        What is a thinking style? It is how we process the world around us. Everyone has their own particular style of doing this, without even realizing it. Some people heavily favor the concrete problems in the present, and do not think much about the overall plan or what may occur in the future. Others may favor a thinking style which is more abstract, less focused on details and more focused on having a plan for any given project and trying to foresee possibilities.
        </p>
        <p>

        People of different thinking styles also pay attention to different types of sensory input. Some people may be visual learners, preferring to see something being done before they can fully grasp it. Others may rely more on hearing a lecture to clear up a topic for them. Still others like to learn through touch and experience, preferring to try to work something out hands on to really understand it.

        I would say I fall into the category of preferring to hear or read about something being done to fully grasp it. Seeing something being done tends to leave me with more questions than answers. I always wonder <i>why</i> someone chose a particular way to do something, and this is not apparent when you watch someone work. I like reading about the thinking behind the work, so I can get a feel for why certain options were chosen over others.
        </p>
        <p>
  
        In reality we use different types of thinking styles throughout the day. Just because we prefer one mode, does not mean that we should try to learn only in that way. I think it is most beneficial to use all the different types of thinking patterns where appropriate. Maybe hearing a lecture will spark an idea for a feature in a project you're working on, even though you're normally a reader. You never know how any particular experience will help you until you go through it and are open to it.

        At the beginning of the program, we were asked to complete a thinking style assessment. This test would determine our thinking style, and give us a better picture of the type of learner we are. We should be able to use this as a metric to try and tailor our experience so that we can learn most effectively, and so that we can be aware of areas we may be weak in. 
        </p>

        <p>
        After taking the test, I got the result that I was an "Abstract Sequential" thinker, here is what that means:</p>
        <div id="quote">

         
        <ul>I like:
          <li>- My point to be heard</li>
          <li>- Analyzing situations before making a decision or acting</li>
          <li>- Applying logic in solving or finding solutions to problems</li>
        </ul>
              
              
              
        
        <ul>I learn best when:
          <li>- I have access to experts or references</li>
          <li>- Placed in stimulating environments</li>
          <li>- Able to work alone</li>
        </ul>
              
              
              
        
        <ul>What's hard for me:
          <li>- Being forced to work with those of differing views</li>
          <li>- Too little time to deal with a subject thoroughly</li>
          <li>- Repeating the same tasks over and over</li>
          <li>- Lots of specific rules and regulations</li>
          <li>- "sentimental" thinking</li>
          <li>- Expressing their emotions</li>
          <li>- Being diplomatic when convincing others</li>
          <li>- Not monopolizing a conversation</li>
        </ul>
              
      </div>
      <p>



        I can see some elements on the list that I identify with and others that I do not. I do tend to work very systematically, and generally like to plan a lot before getting to work. I think this can carry over into programming as a tendency to want to understand a given problem fully, before I get to work on it. I have seen that this can sometimes be a hindrance, because I can get caught up on a part of the problem that I can not solve, and just fixate on that. This is not a good practice from a time management viewpoint. I consciously try to remedy this by writing psuedocode wherever possible, and skipping the implementation of tricky bits until absolutely necessary. This way I can keep working on the parts of the problem I do know, while still having put down a broad overview of the entire problem.
      </p>
      <p>
        I also agree that I learn best alone, but that is because I learn by reading, which is not really a group activity. I definitely do not find having to work with others hard. I enjoy hearing what other people think and it can often give me a new viewpoint on a problem. I also think it will be very beneficial to see other peoples approaches to coding and ask them about why they code in the way that they do. It will help me to broaden my understanding of coding in a way that would be impossible on my own.

        At the beginning of the program we were also asked to read about the concept of a "fixed" and "growth" mindset. This is the belief that some people see the world and themselves as fixed objects, while others see the world and themselves as a growing and changing place. The reason why this is significant is that people with a fixed world view believe that they are unable to change themselves or the world around them, and must manage to get by with just what they have now. People with a growth mindset see themselves as capable of learning and changing. People with a fixed mindset see challenges as something to be avoided, because they are not equipped to deal with them, while people with a growth mindset welcome challenges as an opportunity to learn and grow.   
        </p>
        <p>
        These are good points, but I think the concept is over simplified. People have a range of areas where they feel they are able to learn and grow and other areas where they feel they can not. Usually this is a result of past experiences and confidence. If you've ever struggled with something and come out of it with a better understanding and felt that you were better for it, you will naturally feel good about taking on more challenging things in that realm. If you failed, with no real benefit to yourself, you will naturally see it as something to be avoided. Being able to fail utterly and still see it as a successful learning experience is a very hard thing to do. I think a better suggestion is to not be afraid of taking on challenges, because they're the only way to learn and grow, but also be realistic about your progress and capacity.
        </p>
        <p>
        I think in short it is impossible to pigeonhole a human being as having any one set of characteristics. We are always changing and can switch gears when appropriate. The main thing to keep in mind is that challenges are opportunities to grow and learn. Instead of being frustrated when we don't know the answer to something, or why our code isn't working, we should try to appreciate that muddling through the tough parts is the price of mastery.</p>
