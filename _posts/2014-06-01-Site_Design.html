        <h4><span>Reflections</span></h4>
        <p> As part of this weeks work, we were asked to analyze three of our favorite sites in terms of user experience and design. My picks for the top three were:</p>
        <ul>
          <li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/">Reddit</a></li>
          <li><a href="http://www.wikipedia.com/">Wikipedia</a></li>
          <li><a href="http://www.metacritic.com">Metacritic</a></li>
        </ul>
        <p>I will break down my thoughts on each site individually. Lets start with Reddit.</p>
        <h5><span>Reddit<span></h5>
        <p>I am a fan of reddit's huge amount of content and the ability to tailor what you want to see in your feed. If you put some time into customizing it to your interests, it becomes hugely useful as a source of news and information.</p> 
        <p>Reddit's user interface does not seem like much, but I believe it's that way for a reason. Reddit has no control over the type of content that users will choose to post, so they can not prescribe a default "feel" for the site without alienating users. What if I like bright purple Comic Sans? Why should reddit get to tell me not to use that on my personal sub-reddit? Reddit also has to be able to support a wide range of media types in its submissions. Gifs, jpgs, video and audio must work seamlessly on it. This means that their interface has to be able to deal with a huge amount of possibilities in order to accomodate everyone.</p>
        <p>In general the site is pretty simple, you see your feed of posts, a few very small tabs, and a sidebar with some basic and easily ignored info. I like this approach in that it makes it easy to stay focused on your news feed, but it also hinders user friendliness to a degree. A lot of trial and error, and hunting through menus must be done before you can fully appreciate all the features of the site. There is also no easy way to get an overview of the topics on the site, as I imagine there must be a gargantuan amount of topics, and no real organization to it.</p>
        <p>Reddit is good at being a platform for letting users share content, and it does so while staying in the background as much as possible. You are never distracted by the site itself, which allows you to focus on the content.</p>
        <h5>Wikipedia</h5>
        <p>Wikipedia is one of the best features of the internet. It is a great resource for learning more about any topic you may be interested in, and it's totally free!</p>
        <p>Wikipedia's User experience is very orderly. They have designed it to maximize the ease of retrieving any particular piece of information you are looking for as well as providing links to related topics that you might naturally want to move on to.</p>
        <p>The presence of the search bar on each and every page makes it extremely easy to jump to any topic that comes to mind. They have also further divided topics within any particular subject into similar sections. Any pages about historical figures will have sections for their personal life, professional/political life, any great acheivements and so on. They do the same kind of breakdown for every kind of imaginable topic.</p>
        <p>The site is also designed to be as unobtrusive as possible. The main article is always displayed on a bright white background with black text, so it becomes the highest contrast area on the page, which your eye is naturally drawn to. All the sidebar info is in a smaller font and against a gray background. This lets it fade away and does not draw your attention away from the main article.</p>
        <p>The presence of navigation boxes at the start of each entry also helps you to jump right to the relevant facts that you are looking for. The sections at the end of the entries are very helpful too. They present the citations that went into creating the article as well as links to outside resources, as well as related topics on wikipedia. This enables you to follow your curiosity organically, and you can end up learning a lot more about a topic than you had originally intended. </p>
        <h5>Metacritic</h5>
        <p>Metacritic is a favorite of mine just because of how convenient it is. If I ever want to know whether a Movie/Show/Game is good, I'll come here and check what the reviews are like. In a two minute visit I can get a good sense of what the overall reception to it was and make my decision.</p>
        <p>Metacritic is laid out with an eye towards making the site a very quick read.The use of bold colors and animation makes your eye gravitate towards very specific areas, which are usually information laden. 
        </p>
        <p>You might not even have to search for anything and be able to get the info you need, as the ratings of the most popular search items are automatically being displayed on the landing page. If you do need to search, the search box is easily located, as it is a solid white area within a large black area. Your eyes love how easy it is to spot. </p>
        <p>The use of color on the site is great. All the scores have colors associated with them. Green = good, yellow = ok, and red = bad. You don't even need to take the extra half second to see what the number actually is and you can have an idea of its quality. I really enjoy the emphasis on speed that this site employs.</p>
        <p>They take the challenge of aggregating and organizing reviews from a wide variety of sources and turning it into a useful metric. I no longer have to trudge through multiple reviews in an effort to try to get an unbiased opinion of something. I can just look at the average score and feel pretty confident about its validity.</p>
