        <h4><span>Pair Programming</span></h4>
        <p>One of the things we have to do here at Dev Bootcamp is the practice of pair programming. This was a new concept to me and I initially did not know what to 
        expect. In this week's post I will go over the basics of what this is, and my 
        experience with it so far.
        </p>
        <p>
          The thinking behind pair programming is that in the real world, you have to work
          on a team to accomplish anything in the world of software development. It's a common critique of new programmers that they do not know how to communicate their
          thought process effectively. This is an essential skill to have because no matter
          how good a coder you are, if no-one else can understand what you wrote and the thinking behind it, you are making more work for the people on your team.
        </p>
        <p>
          The main thing pair programming helps to do, is to make sure that you get plenty
          of experience communicating your thoughts to others in a respectful and informative way. It also forces you to become accustomed to other people's thinking
          styles and coding processes. This is a valuable experience to have because you realize that different people can approach problems in their own way, and still be 
          totally correct in the choices they make. This makes it easier to approach code with a more open mind, and appreciate the fact that you are working on a team where all the members are working together, regardless of their individual styles. 
        </p>
        <p>
          Another great aspect of pairing is that you get to learn from your pair and vice versa. Since we are all beginning on this journey of learning to code, we all have an incomplete set of knowledge about languages and best practices. By being exposed to others, it's much quicker to pick up bits and pieces from the different pairings that you do than it is to hunt through books and documentation to hope that you find something relevant to your way of working. This leads to a very 
          organic way of developing your knowledge. It's also very interesting to see how other people tackle things that you take for granted. Just realizing how many different ways there are to approach any given problem is a great learning experience. 
        </p>
        <p>
          Working through tough challenges with a pair is a very fun experience as well. It's a good feeling to experience the enthusiasm and tenacity of your pair, which in turn motivates you and makes you want to be able to give it your all so you can get the problem solved. Successfully solving the problem in a collaborative way is a great learning experience as well. You have to be able to clearly express what your thinking process is, and then also consider your pairs thoughts on the course to take. You have to then objectively weigh the proposed solutions and figure out which is the best approach. It almost feels like a team sport that you and your partner are engaged in. The thrill of successfully solving a problem feels like what I imagine a victory in sports feels like.

          As a part of the pairing process we also have to give and receive feedback for each session. This lets you leave any feedback for your pair that you think they might benefit from hearing. This is a great tool because it let's people receive meaningful feedback about how they are working in a team. This enables people to be aware of their weaknesses and strengths, so they can work towards being a better team member. Having access to feedback like this is invaluable as a learning tool. In the real world no-one will give you such honest feedback, and will most likely just write you off in certain areas with the thought "they are just not good at that aspect". This kind of approach leads to people growing set in their ways and not being open to continuous growth and improvement. 
        </p>
        <p>
          I enjoy this process because it lets me be aware of what it is I can work on, and what aspects of what I do are helpful. All the feedback I've received so far has helped me be aware of certain things I could have done better, and then I consciously try to improve in that area for the next time. I now try to be very direct and clear about what we are trying to have the code accomplish, voice my opinions when I don't fully understand something, and being more organized in my working process. By doing this I think I am becoming a better communicator and team member.
        </p>
        <p>
          I also enjoy leaving people feedback when I feel that there is something that my pair could have been better at doing. It is in no way a critique of them as a person, but rather a point that they could be more conscious of, just in case no-one had ever mentioned it. I like to think that everyone has their own biases, and what may not be enough communication for one person could be the right amount for another. However, if you see the same issue popping up from multiple partners, you can safely assume it is something you are doing, and to try to make a more 
          conscious effort to remedy it.
        </p>
        <p>
          I think pairing is a great way for us to speed up our learning process as well as a way to level up our team working skills. I actually think if more learning institutions utilized some kind of peer feedback system, people would be able to learn much faster, and with more self awareness about how they are perceived by others.
