<h4><span>Exposing You Ignorance</span></h4>

<p>
  One of the biggest aspects of learning at DBC is the 
  practice of exposing your own ignorance. This means that 
  we are encouraged to ask questions about everything that we
  don't understand, as well as refraining from assuming that we
  really "get" anything.
</p>
<p>
  I think this is a good practice because it is one of the best 
  ways to learn. If you already think you know the answer to something
  you are less likely to experiment, and also less likely to learn
  anything new. Nine weeks is way too short of a time to really achieve
  mastery at anything, so we should have no pretension to having done so. We need to focus on just continually exposing every single aspect
  of coding that we don't understand in order to be effective learners.
</p>
<p>
  I try to always be open and honest about my level of competency in any area, and I never really feel bad about admitting to not knowing something. I think my greatest flaw in the area of exposing my ignorance is to too quickly assume that I have a good understanding of a topic, and stop asking more in depth nitty gritty kind of 
  questions about it. This may be stopping me from reaching a really deep understanding of any of those topics. I will be conscious of this as much as possible and try to humbly fill in the gaps in my knowledge. 
</p>
<p>
  Here are a few of the things I don't understand about programming after week 1 of DBC proper:
</p>
<p>1. What exactly is Object orientation?</p>
<p>We've read through the first few chapters of Sandi Metz's Practical Object Oriented Programming in Ruby and I have way more questions than
answers. I tried to implement some of her advice in my Sudoku Solver, 
but I really felt like I was just following the steps, without really understanding.</p>

<p>2. What are the commonly used techniques for structuring data?</p>
<p>As part of the nested array/hash challenges we had to get used to 
parsing really convoluted data structures, with multiple levels of nesting. This just feels wrong to me and I want to see how it's done out in the real world.</p>

<p>3. How do I solve boggle recursively?</p>
<p>This one has bothered me ever since I encountered it in our 
  first week. It feels like a problem that should be solved recursively,
  because you need to do the same step over and over til you find 
  the last letter of the word, but I could not figure out how to keep it
  from going back to letters it has already visited.
</p>
<p>4. What are dependencies?</p>
<p>Another confusing topic brought up in POODR. I have a vague understanding that dependency is when one method really requires 
the functionality of another class to do its job properly, but it 
seems like there is more subtlety to it than that. I am going to 
be worried about this until I actually understand it.</p>
<p>5. How do programmers know what is already out there?</p>
<p>
  It seems like there are resources and pre-built solutions to almost
  all manner of problems already written up and just waiting for use. I'm now wondering what it is that programmers do when most solutions to problems are already out there. Is it just really specific bug 
  hunting that has to be done? It seems like there are convenient 
  frameworks already out there for almost any kind of problem.
</p>
<p>I don't have answers to any of these questions at this time, but I'm hoping to keep asking questions and filling in my areas of ignorance.
