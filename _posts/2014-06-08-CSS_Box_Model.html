        <h4><span>Borders, Padding and Margins!</span></h4>
        
        <p>Borders, margins and padding are one of the fundamental design and layout properties in CSS. Knowing these properties in and out will lead you to a better understanding of how to layout your pages with minimal confusion. CSS treats every block item on your page as a box. This box can further be divided into the layers of margin, padding and border. Margin is the space between one element and another. Padding is extra space added to thie inside of an element, and a border is a border area drawn around the padding and inside the margin. Hopefully the small walkthrough I've put together below can explain it more fully.</p>
        <div class="normal">Normal</div>
        <p>This is a normal div. I have set it to take up exactly 50% of the width of this text area, a height of 75 pixels and have no border or padding. You can see that there is some space between the top and bottom of this div and the paragraphs around it, as well as it being centered in the column. This is due to its margin property. I've set its vertical margins to 25px, and its horizontal margins to auto. This serves to push it 25 pixels away from the elements above and below it, and centers it horizontally.</p>
        <div class ="padded">Padded</div>
        <p>This is the above div, with a padding of 25 pixels added. Padding will add some space around your div to pad it. This can help to keep text from running right up to the edges of elements. Even though I have specified the height and width to be the same as the above "normal" div, you can see it has grown larger. This is because of how the padding property works. By default CSS will add padding to the <i><b>outside</b></i> of your div. We'll look at how to change this behavior a little later. </p>
        <div class="bordered"></div>
        <p>This is an example of a div with all three properties now active. It has the same margin and padding properties from the previous examples, but now it also has a border of 10 pixels applied around it. The border will go around the outside of your div and padding. You can change the thickness of this border to your liking, I have chosen a heavy border for illustrative purposes.</p>
        <div class="normal">Normal</div>
        <div class="sizing_mode"></div>
        <p>Here's where things get really interesting! The first div is the "normal" baseline div we have been using all along. It has a margin of 25px vertically and auto horizontally. Its width is set to be 50% and 75px tall. The second div is exactly the same, but has a 10px border and 25px of padding just like in the other examples, yet it also takes up exactly 50% of the parent element! What's going on? I've changed how the browser is calculating the box sizing. By default the browser will determine the height and width of the content, and then <i><b>add</b></i> padding and border to that. You can change this behavior in your CSS by setting box-sizing to border-box. This mode will assume that you want the total size of the box to be fixed to whatever measurement you specify, 50% of the width in this case. It will then work backward, adding padding and border to the <i><b>inside</b></i> of the box. This makes it much easier to give things percentage based widths, use borders and padding in them and still have them stay the exact space you need them to. </p>
        <div class="column"></div><div class="column"></div><div class="column"></div>
        <p>I can now easily do things like in the above. There are 3 divs set to be 33.3% in width and have no margin between them. If I decide I want to add a border or padding, I can do so and they will still perfectly take up the entire width of the column. Don't believe it? Check this out:</p>
        <div class="column2"></div><div class="column2"></div><div class="column2"></div>
        <p>I can now easily add margins between the divs and create a column layout. As long as the horizontal percentages add up to 100% everything will fit on a line.</p>
        <div class="column3"></div><div class="column3"></div><div class="column3"></div>
        <p>In this example I wanted a 3 column layout and I added a 5% margin to the right side of each div, so right away I knew that 15% of the total width would be dedicated to margin space, leaving me with 85% for content. Now its just a simple matter of dividing 85 by 3 to get the percentage width for each column. This turns out to be 28.3333%. I popped that value into the width for the div and it worked like a charm.</p>
