<p class='project-description'>
  A visual representation of an algorithm that calculates the greatest sum through
  a 2D grid. The constraints are that you have to start at the top left, and go either 
  right or down, and end up at the bottom right tile. You can specify the starting grid
  size, and when you press the 'Find Path' button it will highlight the path. You can 
  also interactively change the tile values to watch the algorithm dynamically recalculate
  the path. Made with pure JavaScript and React for the front-end.
