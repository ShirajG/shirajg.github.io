        <h4><span>Stereotype Threat</span></h4>
        <p>
          This weeks cultural post is about Stereotype threat. I have to admit, I had no idea what this was and had to read some articles about it to understand the issue. My understanding of the issue now is that stereotype threat is when someone feels their behavior is going to confirm a stereotype about their stereotyped group. The example pointed to is that black students under perform white students on standardized tests when they are primed to be aware of being a member of a stereotyped group. There is also some controversy over whether the initial studies by Claude Steele and Joshua Aronson were properly done as they used small and non-representative samples in lab settings which do not reflect the real world. So take this all with a grain of salt.

          The crux of the study though, was that people perform worse on tasks if they are made to feel that the task is something that a group they belong to is not traditionally good at. I can see there being truth to this. A large part of success or failure at any endeavor is the amount of confidence you have in yourself. The more confident you are, the less willing you will be to give up because you feel like it's something "you're not good at". If you are confident, you're more likely to push through hard challenges because you deep down believe you have it in you.

          This was also confirmed by studies that show when a group is primed with positive stereotypes, they perform better. This is called "stereotype boost" by some researchers. When Asian women were primed with positive stereotypes about Asian performance in math, they performed better than the non-primed control group. Interestingly enough when the same group of Asian women was primed with the negative stereotype of women being bad at math, they performed worse than a control group.

          I think this actually goes to show that this is not a racial or gender issue, but really a much larger issue of how a person thinks of themselves. Every person has many different facets to their identity, and while one person may strongly identify with their gender, or race, others may just as strongly identify with their political affiliation, hobbies, or religion. I don't doubt that being exposed to negative stereotypes about the group you identify with can have an impact on your self view, but I think that it's a much larger psychological issue that involves self esteem and self perception.

          I also found it interesting that there is still a question as to how the decreases in performance actually come about. There is some evidence that being primed with a negative stereotype causes an increase in self monitoring, stress and negative thought suppression. All this additional load on your mental and physical capabilities is bound to take its toll, regardless of what the cause of it was. To me this seems like the equivalent of going into a test while worrying about something bad that happened that day. You will be distracted, and some of your cognitive ability will be diverted from the task at hand. Doing any task in a setting where you are stressed and not able to fully concentrate will affect your performance negatively.

        While I agree that everyone should make a serious effort to behave like a pleasant human being who treats everyone with respect, I thought the question that I was asked to write about regarding what I would do when I suspect someone else is experiencing stereotype threat is a slippery slope. This assumes that I am aware of what part of their identity someone else identifies with and having to be vigilant about every possible thing that could <i>possibly</i> be construed as some sort of reinforcement of a negative stereotype. As an example, there's a character on a show called "The Big Bang Theory" who is an Indian character, who I would say exhibits behavior that stereotypes Indians in a negative way. There are also a bunch of negative stereotypes about people that like science or math on that show. There's also a character who is a negative stereotype about creative/artistic people on that show. Which one of those stereotypes do you think bothers me the most? Which one of those groups do I see myslef as a member of? The only way to know for sure, is that you would have to ask me and not assume.

        Gender and race are hot button issues, but the real scope of this problem is even bigger than that. It's an issue of trying to figure out how to design testing and working environments that are devoid of any kind of negative stimuli. Dealing with this problem by trying to sanitize the entire world of any kind of negative experiences is an impossible task. A better strategy would be to deal with individuals responses to exposure to these negative views. People need to be given tools to prevent the internalization of these views and ways to deal with the stress and anxiety caused by them. I think a viable approach to this problem is to train people in cognitive techniques aimed at identifying and controlling negative mental reactions that can decrease performance, or give people some focus enhancing/stress reducing medication if it becomes a serious issue for them. This kind of approach has already proven very effective in cognitive behavioral therapy, which is used to treat anxiety and depression.

          I'm fortunate in that all my stereotypes are pretty positive in terms of academic areas, since I'm an Asian male, so I cant really speak about its effects on me in the arena of learning, and I think it would be disingenuous to say that I can "imagine what its like" because I honestly probably can't. I will say that I think any research into this area will be very helpful to students from all walks of life, and will lead to a more just and equal world.
