<h4><span>Asking Questions</span></h4>

<p>
  As I've been progressing through the challenges in the prep curriculum at DBC, I've learned the value of asking questions. Most problems are usually a result of incomplete knowledge of a method, data structure or syntax. Knowing which of these problems you are encountering and where to get help are crucial to success as a developer. 
</p>
<p>
  As a beginner it can be intimidating to ask questions that you think may be trivial because your lack of knowledge will be exposed. I think getting over this is the first bag step to success. Everyone needs to start somewhere, and every question that you get an answer to is one more little nugget of knowledge that you now possess. Over the years you will accumulate a ton of these little knowledge nuggets, and have a sizable hill of knowledge. If you never ask the questions though, you'll never gain the experience and knowledge that you need to succeed.

  One of the most important skills to learn is to be able to actually pinpoint the issue you need help on. In programming, one small error in one place can lead to a cascade of different errors throughout the program. It's very important to be able to figure out which problem is really the root cause, and which are just symptoms of the original error. 
  This can save you from the wasted effort of trying to treat symptoms rather than the core disease. Once you know what piece of information 
  you actually need, you need to know how to ask for it.
</p>

  The first step to forming a good question is to specify your intent. This is because most of the time in programming, errors are not always obvious. You may run into a run-time error that tips you off that something is wrong, but this does not necessarily mean that the real logic error is on the same line that caused the error to be thrown. If your understanding of a method or data type is incomplete, you may be assuming that you have one type of value that you are working with, but in reality you're working with something entirely different. You won't have any clue about this until you try to use a method that the data doesn't support and it will throw an error. This is why you should be very specific about what it is you are trying to accomplish with your code. There may be nothing syntactically wrong with your code, and no-one will know how to help you unless you tell them what you are trying to accomplish. 
</p>
<p>
  The next step is to be very specific with your wording. Asking a very general question like "Why doesn't this code work?" is not likely to get you very many useful answers. There's just too much room for interpretation in that question. A better question might be something like "Why doesn't this method work on this object that I'm calling it on?" This narrows down the scope of what you are asking for, and anyone trying to answer your question only has to look at a very specific set of properties that will pertain to your problem. This will allow them to give you an answer to exactly what you wanted, rather than point out every flaw in your program and hope that one of them answers your question.  
</p>
<p>
  Another good practice to have for efficient question asking is to really just google it yourself before you try asking others. Chances are if you narrow down your questions well enough, someone else has already asked that question. Various sites like StackOverflow and others focus specifically on answering programming questions. These sites preserve the answers to these questions, so most of the time there isn't even a need to ask the question yourself. With a little bit of searching you can find someone who is asking a question that is either exactly what you are looking for, or is close enough conceptually that you can then take the answer and rework it a little bit for your particular case. This is a huge time saver, and helps you learn very quickly.
</p>
<p>
  Most good questions on stackoverflow will include some mention of what language the code is in as well as a brief description of the problem right in the title. This lets more experienced programmers judge whether or not they can help with the problem at a glance, without having to open up the actual post. The easier you make it for other people to get the gist of your problem, the more likely you are to get an answer. 
</p>
<p>
  Some of the worst posters will post very generic titles to their questions, and unsurprisingly do not get any responses. Heres an example: "Nodejs and socket.io in Openshift." This title isn't even a question, and just lists some languages and a framework. This is like if I were to write "Ruby and file access in rails". This is way too general, and requires everyone to actually read the entire body of my post before they can figure out what my question actually is and whether or not they can help. This is a real waste of someone else's time and I feel like it is inconsiderate as well. Someone else with more experience and knowledge is willing to help you out for free, so you should at least be courteous enough to not waste their time.

  A good example I came across that had multiple answers submitted to it was titled "C++ Pointers, Linked List Confusion". I think this was a great title to use because it specifies the language, and a very basic data structure. People can tell at a glance if they know anything about this topic or not. I could imagine posting something similar like "Need help with Ruby Hash enumeration". This gives someone a pretty good idea of what I might be asking about at just a glance. Narrowing down the problem domain as much as possible will help you to receive the answers you need.
